# Phase 2: ECAN Attention Allocation & Dynamic Mesh Integration

## Overview

Phase 2 extends the foundational cognitive architecture from Phase 1 with dynamic mesh integration, ECAN-style attention allocation, and distributed resource kernel construction. This implementation provides a comprehensive framework for distributed cognitive agents with economic attention allocation and real-time performance monitoring.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Dynamic Mesh Topology (`mesh_topology.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Distributed Agent Management**: Create and manage cognitive agents with different roles
- **Multiple Topology Types**: Ring, fully connected, tree, hybrid, and adaptive topologies
- **Real-time State Propagation**: Propagate state changes across the mesh network
- **Dynamic Agent Communication**: Message passing between distributed agents
- **Topology Optimization**: Adaptive topology based on agent roles and performance

**Agent Roles:**
- **Coordinator**: Central coordination and mesh management
- **Processor**: Cognitive processing and computation
- **Memory**: Distributed memory and knowledge storage  
- **Attention**: Attention allocation and focus management
- **Inference**: Probabilistic logic and reasoning

**Usage Example:**
```python
from cognitive.mesh_topology import DynamicMesh, DistributedAgent, AgentRole, MeshTopology

# Create adaptive mesh
mesh = DynamicMesh(topology_type=MeshTopology.ADAPTIVE)

# Create and add agents
coordinator = DistributedAgent(agent_id="coord_01", role=AgentRole.COORDINATOR)
attention_agent = DistributedAgent(agent_id="attn_01", role=AgentRole.ATTENTION)

mesh.add_agent(coordinator)
mesh.add_agent(attention_agent)

# Propagate state across mesh
state_data = {"attention_focus": ["concept_a", "concept_b"], "priority": "high"}
propagated_count = mesh.propagate_state("coord_01", state_data)
```

### 2. Resource Kernel Construction (`resource_kernel.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Resource Management**: Compute, memory, attention, bandwidth, and storage resources
- **Economic Allocation**: Cost-based resource allocation with priority and urgency factors
- **Distributed Resource Discovery**: Find optimal resource providers across the mesh
- **Automatic Resource Rebalancing**: Load balancing and resource optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time resource utilization and allocation metrics

**Resource Types:**
- **Compute**: Processing power for cognitive operations
- **Memory**: Working memory for active cognitive processes
- **Attention**: Attention allocation capacity
- **Bandwidth**: Network communication resources
- **Storage**: Persistent storage for long-term memory

**Usage Example:**
```python
from cognitive.resource_kernel import ResourceKernel, DistributedResourceManager, ResourceType

# Create resource kernel
kernel = ResourceKernel(agent_id="proc_01", strategy="load_balanced")

# Request resources
request_id = kernel.request_resource(
    resource_type=ResourceType.COMPUTE,
    amount=50.0,
    priority=8,
    requester_id="attn_01"
)

# Create distributed resource manager
manager = DistributedResourceManager()
manager.register_resource_kernel("proc_01", kernel)

# Distributed resource allocation
allocation_id = manager.distributed_resource_request(
    requester_id="attn_01",
    resource_type=ResourceType.MEMORY,
    amount=200.0,
    priority=7
)
```

### 3. Enhanced ECAN Attention Allocation

**Key Features:**
- **Mesh-wide Attention Spreading**: Propagate attention across distributed agents
- **Economic Attention Allocation**: Wages and rents based on utility and novelty
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Coordinate attention across multiple attention agents
- **Real-time Benchmarking**: Performance monitoring of attention allocation

**Integration with Mesh:**
```python
from cognitive.attention_allocation import ECANAttention

# Create attention system with mesh connections
connections = {agent_id: list(connected_agents) for agent_id, connected_agents in mesh_connections.items()}
attention_system = ECANAttention(atomspace_connections=connections)

# Focus attention and propagate across mesh
attention_system.focus_attention("important_concept", 3.0)
attention_system.run_attention_cycle(["important_concept"])

# Get mesh-wide attention statistics
economic_stats = attention_system.get_economic_stats()
```

### 4. Comprehensive Benchmarking (`benchmarking.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-dimensional Performance Testing**: Attention, resource, and communication benchmarks
- **Scalability Analysis**: Performance testing across different agent counts and topologies
- **Real-time Metrics Collection**: Latency, throughput, success rate, and efficiency metrics
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed benchmark reports with visualization data

**Benchmark Types:**
- **Attention Allocation**: Benchmark attention spreading and focus performance
- **Resource Allocation**: Test distributed resource allocation efficiency
- **Mesh Communication**: Measure inter-agent communication performance
- **Full System**: Comprehensive testing across all components

**Usage Example:**
```python
from cognitive.benchmarking import DistributedCognitiveBenchmark, BenchmarkConfig, BenchmarkType

# Setup benchmark environment
benchmark = DistributedCognitiveBenchmark()
benchmark.setup_test_environment(num_agents=10, topology=MeshTopology.ADAPTIVE)

# Configure and run attention benchmark
config = BenchmarkConfig(
    benchmark_type=BenchmarkType.ATTENTION_ALLOCATION,
    iterations=100,
    concurrent_requests=10
)

result = benchmark.benchmark_attention_allocation(config)
print(f"Average latency: {result.metrics['avg_latency']:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Throughput: {result.metrics['requests_per_second']:.2f} req/sec")
```
